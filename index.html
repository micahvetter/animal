 <p class="body">The ivory tusk grows right through the narwhal's upper lip. These tusks can impressively get up to 2.7 m long; although not all narwhals have them. Minus the tusk, adult male narwhals can measure up to 5 m long. Like the beluga whales, narwhals lack a dorsal fin and instead have a dorsal ridge.</p>

    <p class="body">Unlike many of their fellow whale species, Narwhals can be found in the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. In the winter, Narwhals can often be spotted in deep waters, usually beneath icepacks where they can live for up to five months. Once it becomes warmer in the summer they migrate to shallower waters, which usually have much less ice.</p>
